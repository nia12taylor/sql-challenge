Repo for UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp

The SQL script contains six CSV files with employee information. The databases have data from the 1980s and 1990s.

Data Modeling
EmployeeDepartment.png demonstrates the relationships between employees, departments, employees in these departments, departments, employees in each department and the department managers, and the relationship with employees and their title and salaries.

Data Engineering
-Drops the tables if they exists
-Creates the tables with the primary keys
-Recommends next step is to import data from the csv
-Runs ALTER TABLE scripts to add the foreign constraints

Data Analysis

-Employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
-First name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
